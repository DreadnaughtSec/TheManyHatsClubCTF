Name: Beep Beep.

Description: Beep Beep Beep beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep


You are given an audio file, somewhere within the file there is a flag. The beep could indicate a heart rate. The last longer one could flat lining. 

Could add the hint : “Flat line” if need be. 

The flag is made from “oscilloscope music” 

I tested two tools to solve it that will “interpret” the sound: https://dood.al/oscilloscope/ and https://github.com/kritzikratzi/Oscilloscope/
Both work and will give the flag.
