Solution: Username is ken as seen on the screen. Everything hints towards Ken Thompson and his 39 year old password that
has been cracked recently (p/q2-q4!). The sticky note shows a popular chess opening move, in descriptive notation it is 
"p/k2-k4!". Move the pawn from kings 2 to kings 4.

Possible Hint: ZgZliOG1bG3bE
this is a crypt(3) of the password with Zg as salt (just like the original, ZghOT0eRm4U9s:p/q2-q4!)
